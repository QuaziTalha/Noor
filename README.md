## Philosophy

Noor is not just a routing core. It is a **complete micro-framework** built for developers who prefer precision over abstraction, clarity over convention, and performance over noise. With Noor, you get:

* ðŸ§­ A clean, expressive **router**
* ðŸ§± Lightweight **MVC structure**
* ðŸ§© Built-in support for **HTMX** and server-rendered fragments
* âš¡ Zero dependency **SQLite integration**
* ðŸ§  Pure PHP templating with **raw partials** or custom engines

## File Structure

```
/project-root
â”œâ”€â”€ index.php              # Front controller
â”œâ”€â”€ routes.php             # Route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ /controllers           # Controllers (e.g. HomeController.php)
â”œâ”€â”€ /models                # Database Schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ /views                 # HTML views and partials
â”œâ”€â”€ /lib
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Noor.php           # Core framework logic (router, dispatcher)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db.php             # SQLite connection bootstrap
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers.php        # Helpers Methods
â””â”€â”€ /public                # Static assets (css, js, icons)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qoredev/noor-framework.git
cd noor-framework
php -S localhost:8000
```

Make sure `db/database.sqlite` exists and is writable.

## Example Route Definition

```php
// index.php

require 'lib/Noor.php';
require 'routes.php';

$noor->dispatch();
```

```php
// routes.php

$noor = new Noor();

$noor->get('/', 'HomeController@index');
$noor->get('/students', 'StudentController@index');
```
